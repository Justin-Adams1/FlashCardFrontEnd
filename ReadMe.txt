Hello!

Thank you for viewing one of my earlier projects at devCodeCamp\

During this project, we were asked to create what I consider to be our first truly useful app. During this project, we really got to explore the use of React and CSS to deliver a really good looking user experience. I started getting excited about the posibilities. I think this project really opened my drive to succeed as a Full Stack developer. 

Please feel free to check out my other projects to get an idea of my journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer!
